# Read Me Collaboration!!!

My name is Nikolai Meijer, I have lived in London for the majority of my life. I am 17 years old, turning 18 on October 7. I really enjoy design and fashion. I like cars but I cannot afford one right now. My dream car is a Lexus sc400 from 1995 or most old Subaru rally cars.
My name is Jong Woog Yun, had lived in Seoul, Korea. I was born in 1969, a long time ago. I enjoy playing mobile games and golf. And also I'd like to read books. I like driving a car and it will be better if the car is a super car.
